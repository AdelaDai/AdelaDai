## About
Having dreamed of becoming a “business doctor,” Adela interned at consulting firms, including Deloitte Digital and Strategy&. While enjoying tailoring strategies for various clients, she was most interested in providing business insights by analyzing raw data and visualizing key conclusions. Adela continued to join a tech startup developing a game-based marketing app as a business development analyst intern. She accumulated data analytics experience by segmenting app users and evaluating advertising performance. Moving forward, Adela is pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics at UCLA Anderson.

Currently, Adela is a highly motivated product data scientist who is most interested in tech, entertainment, and consulting. She is passionate about deriving insights from data to identify and tackle the stakeholders’ business needs. Her undergraduate background in applied math and psychology at Emory University laid a solid foundation for her quantitative and interpersonal skills.

She also cultivated strong business acumen and data storytelling by leveraging leadership in case competitions and school organizations. She looks forward to contributing her skills to the workplace and driving actual changes.
